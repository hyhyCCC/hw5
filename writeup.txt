For HW5

step to finish this homewor,

1 get a simple .html and .css with those .jpg

2.be carful of the data struct of letter.
 we have one from professor that helps a lot 

3. random get 7 letters for user. and total is 100.
From the data, we need 100 in total, each letter has a number with score.

4. help the user can drop those letter to the right place.
this is the hardest part in the homework.
use some funtion to declear the boxes
and check when user move the tile.
not easy to make those tile dropable.

5. count the source of all the letters
just count the scoure and be carful about double part.
there are two different double.
one is double letter, the other is double all word.
just check do not take mistake on that.

6. get some buttom for restar and next
some buttoms to help user to enjoy the game.
//extra

7. //check that word in dictionary

8.// Full Scrabble board lines 

So in this homework, I really have a simple html and css
I just spend major time in the JQ part about the logic
try to get idea to make user join the game.
I only finish most part of requires and get trouble with the extra parts.
not have a good idea for the blank letter 
which make it diffcult to check the dictionary.

(2) Except for the first letter, all sub-subsequent letters must be placed directly next to or below
another letter with no space. Else, they will bounce back to the “rack”.
this is only one does not work here.
